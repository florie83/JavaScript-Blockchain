# JavaScript-Blockchain

This is a version of JavaScript Blockchain by Spencer Huang (www.spencerhuang.com).

This is not a fork, but is followed from his steps in Medium article (https://medium.com/digital-alchemy-holdings/learn-build-a-javascript-blockchain-part-1-ca61c285821e) and built upon. Into what? No idea yet.
